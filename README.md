## Networks, particulalry economic and social networks, are often skewed with large amounts of resources and attention becoming concentrated in the hands of a few. This allows for economies of scale and relatively inexpensive collective decision making, while a more decentralized network might offer greater variety of products or expression. The optimal balance might faciliate the greatest amount of diversity that a given economy or social network can make use of. I am a researcher working on models which desrobe this optimal configuration and reccomendation algorithms for eccomerce and social networking which help to create such balance. 

I'm currenlty working on a model of strategic network diffusion which might help workers find the best career paths. Find the analysis in the MOBY repository and the paper here on my dropbox ______. I'm also working on a reccomendation algorithm which reccomends the item that is both most related and differentiated to a users current items. Find the code here in my no-scroll repository. 

Currently a masters candidate in quantitative research methods at columbia university where I enjoy taking courses in mostly computer science and statistics.
