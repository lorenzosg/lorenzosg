### Welcome! How confident are you that this page is a good use of your time? Maybe someone else's code and knowledge would be more useful to you. I'm a data scientist and qunatitative researcher subborn about learning optimal search and reccoemendation strategies/functions which can be shown empirically to improve business, economic, and social conditions. Below you'll find links to my naive attempts applying machine learning methods to learn and implement such algorithms. 

💰 which work activities facilitate the greatest amount of econonoic mobility? 
   - I developed a machine learning model which explains 50% of the variation in wage increases for 440+ US workers. Find it here in my MOBY repo:

🛍️ ever wonder which clothing item will improve your style the most?
   - I'm working on an algorithm which learns the wisdom of your favorite stylists, and helps you to complete the greatest number of cool fits 😎
   - The code is here in the no-scroll repo: 

👷‍♂️ one of the greatest joys of learning to code is finding a better way to solve old organizational problems
   - One fun example is when I used the Ekata fraud detection prevention API to validate the contacts of ShowMe Aquatics so they could start fundraising.
