#### Welcome! How confident are you that this page is a good use of your time? Maybe someone else's code and knowledge would be more useful to you. I'm a data scientist stubborn about engineering optimal search and reccomendation algorithms which can be shown empirically to improve business, economic, and social conditions. Below you'll find links to my naive attempts applying machine learning methods to learn and implement such algorithms. 

üí∞ which work activities facilitate the greatest amount of econonomic mobility? 
   - I built a machine learning model which explains 50% of the variation in wage increases for 440+ US workers. [Find it here in my MOBY repo!](https://github.com/lorenzosg/MOBY)
   - As part of the analysis, I had to embed work activity data in order to create a large network/graph which describes the relatedness between work activities, based on their co-occurence in various jobs. I found that creating this co-occurence matrix was a multi-step process. So, I wrote and published a package to make these computations easy and seamless, [networkd](https://github.com/lorenzosg/networkD). Simply import networkd as nd and nd.embed your data of the same format! (for example: movies and genres, songs & playlists, words & documents, ect.)

üõçÔ∏è ever wonder which clothing item will improve your style the most?
   - I'm working on an [algorithm](https://github.com/lorenzosg/no-scroll) which learns the wisdom of your favorite stylists, and helps you to complete the greatest number of cool fits üòé

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è one of the greatest joys of learning to code is finding a better way to solve old organizational problems
   - One fun example is when I used the Ekata fraud detection prevention API to validate the contacts of ShowMe Aquatics so they could start fundraising.
